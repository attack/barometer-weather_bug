# Barometer::WeatherBug (deprecated)

It appears WeatherBug has shut down their API service.  This code will not be useful for getting the weather.

A wrapper for the WeatherBug weather API. This wrapper is
barometer compatiable and can be used with or without barometer.

## Usage

This wrapper was designed to be used via [Barometer](https://github.com/attack/barometer), or on its own.

### Directly

By using this wrapper directly, you lose any Barometer aggregation and
failover capabilities. Barometer is still dependency to provide a
framework for query conversion, weather service integration and data
processing.

```ruby
query = Barometer::Query.new('42.7243,-73.6927')
keys = {client_id: 'client_id', client_secret: 'client_secret'}

result = Barometer::WeatherBug.call(query, keys: keys)
puts result.current.temperature.c
```

### via Barometer

Barometer is a weather service framework, providing aggregation and failover
capabilities. To make WeatherBug available to Barometer, you must register
it as an available weather service.

```ruby
Barometer::WeatherService.register(:weather_bug, Barometer::WeatherBug)
```

Then follow the instructions provided by [Barometer](https://github.com/attack/barometer).
